### Multi-Agent

Multi-agent systems consist of multiple decision-making agents that interact in a shared environment to achieve common or conflicting goals.

- [agent-supervisor](./main.go): An example of a multi-agent system with an agent supervisor to help delegate tasks. In the example, the Leader delegates tasks to RD (Research and Development) and QA (Quality Assurance), if the code doesnâ€™t pass the test, it is sent back to RD for rewriting and then tested again, and the Leader makes corresponding decisions based on feedback, finally returning the tested code.
